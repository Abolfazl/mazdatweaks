# MZD-AIO-TI 2.x.x CHANGELOG  [![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/trevelopment/AIO-Updates/MZD-AIO-TI/images/download.svg?version=MZD-AIO-TI) ](http://dl.mazdatweaks.win)

##### FOR [AIO v1.x.x CHANGELOG](/CHANGELOG) or visit [MazdaTweaks.com]


### 2.5.9


**Fixed  CastScreen-Receiver**

**Include AA v0.99 Install**

##### SSH_Bringback:
- A second root user/pass - jci/jci is now added.
- This is to give AIO a unique user to check the passwd file to ensure SSH is actually re-enabled.
- Added 'Force SSH' option that will force update SSH settings. For FW < 56.00.511 this will change the root user to cmu (and add second root user jci).
  - I personally did this on my v55.00.753A-NA and added a few of my own root usernames as well.
- For more information I am adding a 'Pro Tips' page to MazdaTweaks.com The first entry will be about the importance of SSH access + how to add your own user/pass to your system.

##### JCI backup
- Zip Backup Option
  - Creates a .zip file containing your backup JCI folder
  - Takes longer than a regular backup
  - You cannot create both a regular backup and a zipped backup in the same installation, that would take a very long time.
- When an unknown firmare version is encountered AIO now does one of 3 things:
 - If FW < v55: Shows user a message that AIO is not compatible and they need to update to FW v55+ to use AIO.
 - If FW >= 58: Shows user a message that AIO is not compatible and a choice is given to make a JCI backup and instructions on where to send it to test for compatibility.
 - If FW = 55 or 56: All FW v55 & v56 will pass the initial compatibility check but **may not pass compatibility checks for certain tweaks** meaning those teaks will be skipped during installation.
  - Email aio@mazdatweaks.com if you need assistance with an incompatible firmware, unless you are have FW less than v55 then just update to v55 or higher.
  
_**Force SSH and Zip Backup options are collapsed by default because they are only needed for certain situations and are not recomended to run with every install.**_

###### Added Compatible FW:
  - 59.00.446A-NA
  - 59.00.450A-NA
  - 59.00.447A-EU
  - 59.00.449A-EU
  - 59.00.449A-ADR
  - 59.00.450A-ADR
  

### 2.5.6

- PATCHES:
  - Fixed the Error Message Display in the VideoPlayer
    - It says to reboot your CMU but sometimes exiting and reopening the app is enough
    - Of coarse if it keeps happening then reboot
  - Fixed a typo in the 'order of audio source' tweak
  - Fixed transparency in images when resizing especially 'blank album art'
    - Electron changed something in the resize API, now its faster. Cropping may be coming soon too!
  - Fixed Boot Animation compile failing whey no option is chosen
  - Temporary Remove Criss-Cross Boot Animation (Not Working)


### 2.5.5
- **VIDEO PLAYER V2.9**
  - Full multicontroller functionality
    - Scroll and Select Video List (cw/ccw - select)
      - List looping in selection and playback
    - Scroll and Select Options (tile-right/left - select)
  - Previous track
    - Play Previous Video
  - Repeat all option
    - Recently Played Videos are not repeated in shuffle mode until the entire list is played.
    - Toggling Repeat All will clear recently played videos list.
  - Save Configuration To Local Storage
    - Utilize the CMU's Local Storage to save options even after a reboot.
    - All option choices AND recently played video list are saved to local storage.
  - More Touch Controls During playback
    - Control next/prev/ff/rw and more by tapping sections of the touch screen.
    - See [Touch Screen Control Map](/app/files/img/scrnCtrlMap.jpg) for details
 - Removing Navigation SD card **will improve video player performance** this is due to the memory issues that exist within the MZD system.
 - Installation of the swapfile will also improve performance, swap mounting has been improved.

##### Want more info on the Video Player? Check out the [Video Player Repository](http://trevelopment.win/videoplayergithub)

- **CUSTOM BOOT ANIMATIONS**
  - Change all or part of the boot animation (Default 'Disabled' Animation Uses Default LoopLogo for all 3 parts of the sequence allowing for the shortest boot time the illusion of no boot animation)
  - Boot Animation Sequence Goes: LoopLogo[1] => TranLogo[2] => TranLogoEnd[3]
  - Choices:
    - Mazda Logo (Default LoopLogo) [All]
    - Matrix [All]

___

   - Fixed error when choosing CarOS theme
   - Improved SwapFile Mounting
   - SSH_Bringback is now selected by default
   - App List Patch is automatically applied to v59 when installing apps if no-more-disclaimer and order of audio source list are not installed
   - Some Layout Improvements

 - **Unconfirmed Fix For CastScreen**
   - **Adds Port 53515 (ADB Default Port) To Firewall IPTables Accepted Connections**
   - If this fix works for anyone let me know.


### 2.4.3
- Did somebody say **VIDEO PLAYER MUTICONTROLLER SUPPORT??** YES I DID!
  - ButtonPress = Play/Pause
  - Tilt-Right = Next
  - Tilt-Left = Stop
  - Tilt-Up/Down = Scroll Video List
  - Rotate-CC/CCW = RW/FF
    - RW/FF Frame skip time lowered from 30s -> 10s
    - Because with the wheel rotation, 30 second jumps are too much
- Speedometer Variant Option:
 - Start App In Analog Mode
 

### 2.4.2
- Reverted Compatibility for 'Media Order Patch & FLAC Support' tweak.
  - Compatibilities with issues are neatly commented out in the code for  testing purposes.
  - Toned down the warning message.
  - I appreciate all those who help out on this issue, Lets try getting these compatibilities all straightened out.
- Choosing 'Media Order Patch & FLAC Support' will auto-choose SSH_Bringback (It can be unselected but that is not recommended).
- Speedcam Patch Compatibility should be ok but should be **considered a beta test for FW. ver. 59.00.411A-NA & 59.00.443C-EU.**


### 2.4.0 Release
- **Android Auto Bugfixes**
 - re-enables the dialer interface if the phone is paired and connected to the headunit via BT (Not Completely fixed, Still an Issue)
 - fix issue for screen corruption with backup camera
 - Increase the size of the USB receive buffer to 16384
- I was a little nervous while confirming this because I have run AIO in my car hundreds of times - To apply "Remove Message Replies" tweak you **must factory reset your settings after installing**.
  - Since nothing bad happened to me after countless experimental system modifications, it is unlikely that factory resetting options would cause any damage.
  - Edit messages for your language in blm_msg-system.xml to start with your own preset messages.
- 2 new smooth themes by Zephnath
 - Smooth Azure (Blue)
 - Smooth Violet (Purple)
- Added Compatible Firmware: v56.00.403A-JP

- Works better and Looks better too!
- No need to uninstall, just install over old Video Player to update

##### Android Auto v1.02 Update - By: Khantaena
- "Android Audio" menu option no longer starts the process, instead it tells the phone to ask for video focus again if you have pressed the physical "Home" button and left the AA UI.
- Refactor code into a long-running service that starts on CMU boot. Allows auto-start on phone connection.
- Fix bug in focus handling when the audio focus is lost externally. No longer gets stuck unfocused

### 2.2.4:

 - Fallbacks Are Commented Out - So If You Really Need One You Can Get It
  - This Leaves Only One Assumption That AIO Follows: Any File That Has Been Modified Will Have A Backup Of The Original As A .org File.

### 2.2.0:
**MAJOR CODE REFACTORING**
###### Tweak Files - All around improvements in coding style, efficiency, logging, compatibility, commenting, and error handling
###### IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED NO-MORE-DISCLAIMER, ORDER OF AUDIO SOURCE LIST, OR IMPROVED LIST LOOP MOD ON FW V59 PLEASE REINSTALL (OR UNINSTALL) BECAUSE THE FILES USED IN YOUR INSTALLATION WERE NOT UPDATED TO YOUR FIRMWARE.
###### ALSO, YOU MUST INSTALL NO-MORE-DISCLAIMER OR AUDIO SOURCE LIST ORDER (OR BOTH) FOR APPS TO APPEAR IN THE APP LIST ON V59 ALL UPDATED FILES IN AIO V2.2.0 WERE UPDATED FROM FW V59.00.441A-NA SO CONTINUE TO BE CAREFUL (THOUGH ALL FW V59 SHOULD BE COMPATIBLE SINCE USING FILES FROM V55 ON V59 WAS STILL WORKING FOR THESE TWEAKS).

##### Notable Changes:

  - Clock Color Also Applies to Statusbar-Mini-Speedometer (Even In Reverse :+1:)
  - Status Notification Color Includes all types of notifications (not just nav).
  - **IT IS RECOMENDED THAT YOU UNINSTALL THE DATE TO STATUSBAR MOD V2 BEFORE INSTALLING V3.  IT IS NOT REQUIRED BUT IT WILL PRODUCE BETTER RESULTS.**
- Date To Statusbar Mod v3.3 is compatible with all FW v55-v58 and:
  - 59.00.330A-EU
  - 59.00.331A-EU
  - 59.00.330A-NA
  - 59.00.441A-NA
  - 59.00.443A-NA
  - 59.00.443C-ADR
  - 59.00.326A-ADR  
- Mini Speedometer automatically hides the notification border without date to statusbar mod
- Fixed a typo causing the blue nav color scheme to fail to uninstall.  Now it is removed when changing back to default (red).

# MZD Meter

**One day I received an email of these MZD Meter files** by a random person whom I did not know and offered very little information about them. The files did not include all the files needed to run the app nor did it include an install script.  I took some time to get the app to actually work but many of the features/readings do not work correctly, some not at all.  There are so many things going on in the app and it became difficult and tedious for me to debug/fix the app myself so I ask my fellow hackers in the community to take a look at the source code and attempt to get this app fully working, maybe even improve on it by. For instance presently only km/h is shown, to toggle between km/h and mph would be a great feature but the limits are really anything you can imagine.

**To find the MZD Meter install/uninstall inside MZD-AIO-TI** just type `mzdmeter` (one word) into the 'Tweak Filter' text input field at the top right of the app.  I know its not a very tough secret code to figure out but what are the chances that somebody actually uses that 'Tweak Filter' field AND types exactly that into it by accident? Not very high but if someone did, good for them, in that case they should find it.  I only hide the app because of the amount of things that do not work and I'm hoping with the help of the community we can fix it and ultimately make it into something better.

#### What is working for me:
- Main Speedometer (km/h only)
- Steering Wheel positon
- Gear shift position
- Trip time
- The annoying beeping that alerts you that your wheels are not straight when parking.
